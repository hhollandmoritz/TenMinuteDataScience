Code commenting dos and donts

modular code

-   writing functions

-   purrr

pipeline basics (automating repetative tasks with make files, functions, and nextflow?)

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
